 1. **Business Logic Vulnerability:** Business logic vulnerabilities are flaws in the design and implementaiton of an application that allow an attacker to elicit unintened behavior. This potentially enables attackers to manipulate legitimate functionality to achieve a malicous goal. These flaws are generally the result of failing to anitipate unusual application states that may occur and, consequently, failing to handle them safely.
    * ***Business Logic*** *simply refers to the set of rules that define how the application operates. As these rules aren't always directly reated to a business, the associated vulnerabilites are also known as "application logic vulnerabilities" or simply "logic flaws".
